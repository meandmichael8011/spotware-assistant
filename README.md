# Agentic RAG System ‚Äî Spotware Assessment Submission

Dear Spotware Assessor,  
Thank you in advance for your time and effort in reviewing this project.

---

## üß† Project Overview

This repository contains all the code for an **AI-driven agentic RAG system**.

To showcase **multi-step reasoning and agentic flow**, the agent operates over public financial information using:

- Common currency knowledge
- Yahoo Finance API
- Dynamic visualizations

The system is powered by **three tools**:

1. **General Currency Info Tool**  
   Uses similarity search over embedded documents (powered by `Voyage-3-large`, chosen for its superior retrieval performance).

2. **Currency Price Lookup Tool**  
   Fetches open/close values for currency pairs (including crypto) via the **Yahoo Finance API**.

3. **Currency Chart Visualization Tool**  
   Dynamically generates and stores visual outputs as `.png` images.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

This project requires **Python 3.12**. All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`, and you'll need to provide **two API keys** via a `.env` file:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `VOYAGE_API_KEY`

> üí° The token usage is minimal.

### üîß Local Setup (Recommended)

To run locally in a virtual environment:

```bash
# 0. Unzip the archive in a directory of your choice
# 1. Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`

# 2. Navigate into the project folder
cd your_project_directory

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Input your API keys
Edit the .env file in the directory - you need to put in two API Keys in the corresponding fields (one for VoyageAI - you can find it on https://www.voyageai.com/), and the other - for OpenAI (you can find it on https://openai.com/api/). Input both keys and save the changes. If everything's correct, the app should be running. In case if the app does not respond for some reason, please go into the aprod.py file, incomment two 'os.environ' lines and put your keys in manually.

# 5. Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run aprod.py

## üê≥ Docker Notes (Final Image)

For your convenience, I have also **dockerized the application**. The final container is approximately **6.5 GB** in size, mainly due to **PyTorch dependencies**.

This image allows you to **fully explore the app‚Äôs core functionality**, including:

- Answering multi-step currency queries
- Tool-based reasoning via LangGraph
- Embedding-based document retrieval

However, if you'd like to see the `graph_output` node in action (which **generates and saves a currency chart as a `.png`**), you‚Äôll need to:

1. **Enter the container‚Äôs shell**
2. **Navigate to the directory where the chart is saved**, e.g., `/app/frontend/saved_figures`
3. **Manually access or export the image**

### üß™ Pull and Run

```bash
docker pull meandmichael8011/spotware-app:latest
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env meandmichael8011/spotware-app:latest
